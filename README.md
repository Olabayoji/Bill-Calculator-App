# Bill-Calculator-App
This is a bill calculator app from the frontend mentor challenge 
I engaged this challenge using HTML, CSS and basic javaScript. I could have used jQuery instead but used vanilla js to have a good grasp of js.
My codes could have been cleaner but i wanted to finish the challenge before the deadline i set for myself. I would revist it so as to make it cleaner in due time. 

Things i learnt from this challenge include:
- How to use and cases to use the onchange eventListener
- How to use css grid systems. (My firt time using the CSS grid system).
